# Nixie

Some circuit deal to deal with Nixie tubes.


## Power supply
The circuit was made to turn on ИН-14 (IH-14 with latin alphabet) tubes. The output voltage can be adjusted between 70 V and 240 V, making it suitable for other kinds of tubes.

You can find more information on this circuit on my blog (in French): https://gradot.wordpress.com/2015/03/10/alimentation-tubes-nixie/


## Time reference generator
The circuit generates a stable time reference. This is a square clock signal. Jumpers allow to select either 1 Hz, 2 Hz or 4 Hz as the output frequency.

## Other circuits
Still work-in-progress attempts. Come back later :)
