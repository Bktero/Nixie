# Nixie

Circuit to power up Nixie tubes.

Maybe, one day, morce circuits to deal with Nixies.

## Power supply
The circuit was made to turn on ИН-14 (IH-14 with latin alphabet) tubes. The output voltage can be adjusted between 70 V and 240 V, making it suitable for other kinds of tubes.

You can find more information on this circuit on my blog (in French): https://gradot.wordpress.com/2015/03/10/alimentation-tubes-nixie/
